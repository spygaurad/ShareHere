# What is ShareHere?

ShareHere is an application that let's you upload, store, and download all the files available in the server. It doesnt require an active internet connection but needs users to be in same network to access the files. The project was created as to remove students problem in my college, i.e slow internet. We always had to download same softwares, .iso's repeatedly so why not maintain a server to store it?
